                                it’s difficult to comprehend the sheer power of a disaster like this. Floods are the
                                natural disaster that can literally force homes off of their foundations and push them
                                across the ground. Such events can cause immense harm, destroying anything and
                                everything in their path. Of all the natural disasters, these ones also exert the
                                greatest cost in human life. The two worst natural disasters in recorded history were
                                both floods.</p>

                            <p>The various types of water risk zones are given specific designations to differentiate
                                them. These designations also determine whether or not homeowners will need to purchase
                                insurance as a part of their mortgage. According to one resource, “AE flood zones are
                                areas that present a 26% chance over the life of a 30-year mortgage, according to FEMA.
                                Since these areas are prone to flooding, homeowners with mortgages from federally
                                regulated lenders are required to purchase flood insurance through the NFIP.”</p>

                            <p>On 15 July 2024, students of Dhaka University were sitting with placards and flags in a
                                peaceful protest calling for reforms on the quota allocation for government jobs in
                                Bangladesh. Suddenly, they were attacked by individuals armed with rods, sticks and
                                clubs with a few even brandishing revolvers. Within hours, a pattern emerged across the
                                country with similar attacks coordinated by people believed to be members of the
                                Bangladesh Chatra League (BCL), a group affiliated with the ruling Awami League (AL),
                                against student protesters.

                                By the afternoon of 16 July, police fired tear gas and charged with batons drawn at
                                protesters in front of Begum Rokeya University in the north-western city of Rangpur
                                where students had gathered, led by the protest coordinator Abu Sayed among others.
